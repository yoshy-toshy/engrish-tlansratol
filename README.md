## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
1. Open it in your web browser.

## Note

As you might know, Japanese people often get R and L mixed up because we cannot tell R from L. Some people call it "Engrish."

This tool helps you translate "Engrish" into English. It converts all R's into L's, and L's into R's. It means, not only "herro" changes into "hello," but also "hello" changes into "herro."

I do not know what you are using this tool for, but hope it helps.
